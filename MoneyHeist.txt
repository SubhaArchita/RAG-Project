As children, we may have entertained the idea of printing our own currency using our home printer. While most of us eventually learned that our printers were not capable of such a feat, a small part of us longed for the possibility of success. But life has a way of dashing our hopes and leaving us to accept its disappointments.

However, there are those who refuse to give up on their dreams. In Spain, a man brought together a group of misfits at a mansion in the countryside and unveiled a grand plan that had its fair share of bumps in the road. Despite the challenges, they managed to pull off something that we could only dream of as children — creating their own currency. And this was just the beginning of the thrilling tale known as The Money Heist.

From the very first episode, this series had me hooked. I found myself taking notes on my couch with a notepad and pen in hand, completely enthralled by the action and suspense. Through this show, I’ve learned five valuable lessons about writing that I’d like to share.

Perfect Beginning
Tell your readers what the story is all about as early as possible. Set the rules of the game, set pieces on the board, and start playing.

As you turn the first page of a new book, you’re filled with excitement and anticipation. You dive into the story, savoring each word, entranced by the characters and the world they inhabit. But as the pages fly by, you realize you have no idea what the story is really about. You’re lost in a sea of words, bobbing along without a compass to guide you.

But then, suddenly, a beam of light breaks through the clouds. You see the story’s true purpose, and everything falls into place. The conflicts grow more intense, the characters more complex, and you can’t turn the pages fast enough.

Now, imagine a story that starts with that same sense of clarity and purpose. From the very first sentence, you know exactly what you’re in for. The rules of the game are laid out before you, the pieces of the puzzle placed perfectly on the board. You’re ready to play.

That’s the kind of beginning Money Heist has. It grabs you by the collar and doesn’t let go, weaving a tale of intrigue and excitement that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It’s a perfect example of how to start a story off right, setting the stage for a journey you won’t soon forget.

Crescendo of Conflicts
Conflict is the driving force behind any good story. It’s what gives your characters the chance to grow and develop, and it’s what keeps your audience on the edge of their seats. In Money Heist, conflict is everywhere. The characters are constantly at odds with each other, as well as with the outside forces trying to bring them down.

But it’s not just the conflicts themselves that make Money Heist so compelling. It’s also the way the show handles the moments in between. The writers expertly weave in anecdotes and conversations that not only give us insight into the characters but also serve to ratchet up the tension. One minute we’re laughing at a story from the training days, and the next we’re holding our breath as a gang member’s life hangs in the balance.

So, when you’re crafting your own story, don’t be afraid to pile on the conflicts. Just make sure to give your characters the space to breathe and grow in between. It’s those quiet moments that will make your conflicts all the more powerful when they do come to a head.

Beauty of Flaws
As the old saying goes, “Black and white are a thing of the past; grey is the new normal.” The characters in the show Money Heist are no exception to this rule. Even The Professor, the mastermind behind the heist, has his own fears and flaws. From misogynistic tendencies to narcissistic behavior, the characters in the show are a diverse mix of imperfections. But it is these very imperfections that make them so relatable and human. Each character has a past or a secret that shapes their actions, and it is the combination of their strengths and weaknesses that makes them unique and three-dimensional.

But it’s not just only their flaws that make the characters of Money Heist so memorable. It’s also the small, personal moments that truly bring them to life. Whether it’s a moment of happiness, a prank, or just a moment of pure stupidity, these are the moments that connect us to the characters and make us root for them.

So, the lesson here is clear: in order to create relatable and memorable characters, it’s important to let them be flawed and empathetic. After all, it’s the imperfections that make us truly human.

Tokyo — The Unpredictable
In the show, Tokyo is the character that everyone turns to when things start to spin out of control. Even the writers of the show rely on her for inspiration when it comes to crafting the plot.

However, as the show progresses and the conflicts escalate, it can be easy for the plot to become repetitive. If there isn’t enough time for the characters to react and recover, the story can lose its touch of realism.

That’s where Tokyo comes in. She is impulsive and unpredictable, and that’s exactly what keeps the show interesting. When the Spanish police or intelligence agency takes action against the gang and The Professor’s strategies successfully counter their moves, there is enough time for the opposing team to regroup and come up with a new plan. Similarly, when the hostages come up with their own schemes, Tokyo’s reactions set off a chain of events that keep the show fresh and exciting.

In summary, to keep a story “on edge” and avoid it becoming dull, it’s important to have a character or element that adds an element of unpredictability. For the show in question, that character is Tokyo, whose impulsive actions help to keep the plot moving forward and avoid any lulls in the action.

Symbolic Significance
Money Heist is a thrilling show about resistance and a refusal to conform to the system. At the heart of the show is the Professor, a mastermind who leads his team in heists that are not only daring and complex but also serve as a form of resistance against the establishment.

But the show’s themes of resistance and skepticism towards society are not just conveyed through the Professor’s words and actions. The show also uses powerful symbols to represent these ideas. The Salvador Dali masks worn by the team during the heists symbolize their anonymity and their rejection of societal norms. The red jumpsuits, worn by all members of the team, represent their unity and their commitment to their cause. And the phrase “Bella Ciao,” which is sung by the team during the heists, is a symbol of resistance against oppression and injustice.

Overall, Money Heist uses these symbols in a compelling way to represent the core themes of resistance and skepticism toward society. As viewers, we are drawn into the story and fully immersed in the world of the show, experiencing the thrill of resistance alongside the characters. It’s a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for what we believe in and refusing to be controlled by the expectations of society.
