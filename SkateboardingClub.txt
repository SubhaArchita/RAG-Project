Old Business
Our event registration for the Skate Board workshop was approved.  We need to
submit the Room Reservation Form to Mark Massinda to book Webb Lawn for
the 20th of April.  C. Spaulding volunteered to take care of this.  We will vote on
the funding for this event next week.
We need to discuss our Trip to NY on April 28th
.  The hotel faxed us an invoice
for $1,010.00.  We were able to get University Vans to drive down there but they
will cost $20 to park them for the weekend.  We also need to decide if we are
going to pay for meals for those going.
Motion #11: (M. Spaulding/Brown) To allocate $1,010.00 in a Purchase Order to
the Best Western to pay for our hotel for April 28th out of our budget account.
8 in favor/0 opposed/0 abstentions.  Motion Carries
Motion #12: (Caplette/Tynan) To allocate $20.00 in a cash advance to KayTe
Bettencourt to pay for parking in NY for the night of April 18 th from our budget
account.

The most that we could give each person for their meals for the two days is
$96.00.  We are bringing 20 people.  If we gave each person the max that would
be $1,920.00  This money is coming out of our fundraising account.  We want to
pay for as much as we can as those going are paying for the skate expo on their
own but we don’t want to wipe out our fundraising account.
Motion #13: (Brown/Casie) To allocate $1,000.00 ($50 per person) for meals in
a cash advance to Valerie Nettleton for our trip to NY on the 18th from our
fundraising account.  6 in favor/2 opposed/0 abstentions.  Motion Carries
