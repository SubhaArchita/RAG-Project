BillGates.txt_chunk1,"TRANSCRIPT: Introduction RAJ SHAMANI: Before we start today’s episode, all I want to say is thank you to each and every one of you. I’m really grateful that we were able to sit down with one of the most influential men in the world, Bill Gates. I have been this young boy who always used to hear stories about this man, about the kind of money he has made, the kind of lives he’s impacting, the kind of things he’s building through Microsoft from there. To be sitting in front of him, it was surreal. When I started the conversation, you could see it on my face that I was really nervous, really scared. I didn’t know what to talk about. But as we went in the conversation, the podcaster in me took over and we spoke about his fears, his misunderstandings, the mission, and what he is doing today. Today I want you to see this episode from a lens of a 20-year-old sitting with Bill Gates and figuring out what goes on in his brain. This episode is truly special because I could have never thought that Bill Gates will be on our podcast this soon. In our journey, I always had a belief that we will be able to sit down with the smartest people around the world. But it’ll happen this soon. I can’t believe this right now. I just want you to enjoy this episode the way I did. I want you to sink in that this is happening because it’s not sinking in with me. And I just want to tell you that there are more episodes coming. So keep supporting us and hit the subscribe button right now. Welcome on Figuring Out, sir. I’ll tell you a little story. So during the pandemic,",BillGates,BillGates.txt,

So keep supporting us and hit the subscribe button right now. Welcome on Figuring Out, sir. I’ll tell you a little story. So during the pandemic, me and my sister, we were watching the Netflix documentary “Inside Bill’s Brain.” And halfway through it, I told my sister that, “Hey, you know what? One day I’ll sit with Bill Gates and I’ll directly speak to him and get inside his brain,” just randomly. And she was laughing. So this one’s for you. BILL GATES: You did it. Observations About India RAJ SHAMANI: Yeah. So it’s an opportunity. I don’t know how. It just came out of my mouth, and it’s happening today. So thank you so much for doing this. Well, you’ve come to India quite often. Tell me something that you have observed about India, which a lot of people don’t know about. BILL GATES: Well, people probably, because they’re here all the time, don’t recognize how much things have changed. If you go away and come back, then you see, wow, the level of entrepreneurship and the amount of innovation that’s actually taking place here. It’s pretty fantastic. And for the foundation, we’ve been here originally because a lot of the health challenges were here, and we still care a lot about that. But now a lot of our invention is being done here, whether it’s vaccines, obviously, we have some incredible partnerships, but it’s broadening to better seeds, better diagnostics, the ways that we can use AI for health or education. So the innovation ecosystem has really exploded, and that’s going to be great for India. It’s going to be great for the world.",BillGates,BillGates.txt,

So the innovation ecosystem has really exploded, and that’s going to be great for India. It’s going to be great for the world. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: So when you meet other leaders around the world or when you meet your billionaire friends, what’s the first thing you tell them about India? Is it the same thing, what you just told me? BILL GATES: Yeah, it’s, you know, we had such a great experience in our work in India. I encourage people to come and tap into the great things going on. RAJ SHAMANI: Is there anything specific you tell them? A) BILL GATES: Well, my connection with India goes all the way back to the Microsoft days when we at first would hire people from India and bring them to the United States. And both the United States and India were kind of mad at us because we were taking the smart people and moving them, and then they came back here to India and created the Microsoft India work, which has been absolutely fantastic. So, up until the year 2000, I mainly knew the tech scene. So, a lot of Bangalore, Hyderabad, seeing the country more broadly, that’s in my foundation work. So, Bihar up, seeing where we could partner and help with things. I still want to take more vacation here. I’ve done a little bit, but there’s a lot of great places in India that I haven’t been to.

India’s Global Talent Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Talking about Microsoft and taking people from here to US. People like Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai. There have been incredible CEOs around the world. Why do you think India is becoming a global talent capital for the world? Do you think anything special here which is out there? A) BILL GATES: Well, 20% of the world’s people live here in India. And India’s had a particular emphasis on engineering software, and turned out a lot of top people. And so when you get people like Sundar Satya, who are both great at engineering and management, that’s a magic combination. And these companies are looking anywhere in the world to find that mix. And so India’s getting about its fair share of those top leadership positions. It partly comes from having great universities, not just the IITs, but starting with them, that’s using the incredible talent that’s here. Philanthropy and Inheritance Q) RAJ SHAMANI: So talking about Indian talent, you do a lot of philanthropy work here and you’ve met a lot of talented people here, a lot of rich people here as well. Do you believe that all the money that rich people have or like people who have made wealth for themselves, they should use it for charity work, they should pledge it. In India, there’s usually a lot of people believe that as parents, it is their duty to save everything for their kids, for the inheritance, right? Like the kids will get everything. What do you think is the right mindset? Using all the money for pledging and giving it back to the society or giving it to the children? A) BILL",BillGates,BillGates.txt,
BillGates.txt_chunk5,"parents, it is their duty to save everything for their kids, for the inheritance, right? Like the kids will get everything. What do you think is the right mindset? Using all the money for pledging and giving it back to the society or giving it to the children? A) BILL GATES: Well, I think everybody gets to decide on that. In my case, my kids got a great upbringing, education, but less than 1% of the total wealth because I decided it wouldn’t be a favor to them. It’s not a dynasty. I’m not asking them to run Microsoft. I want to give them a chance to have their own earnings and success, be significant and not overshadowed by the incredible luck and good fortune I had. Different families see that differently. I think the people who’ve made fortunes from technology are less dynastic and so they’ll even take their capital and give a lot of that away. You can have the view of giving away your capital or just giving away your earnings. And, of course, I love all philanthropy, but the tech sector is probably the most aggressive about giving most of it away. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Now, there are other sectors. You have not seen that in any other kind of industry where people try to give? A) BILL GATES: Not to the same degree. It tends to be giving more of the profit as opposed to the actual base capital. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: You know, in India, a lot of kids also fight with their parents on inheritance. Have your kids ever spoken to you and be like, “Hey, why are you not giving us everything or anything?” Has it ever happened? A) BILL GATES: You know, you don’t want your kids to ever be confused",BillGates,BillGates.txt,
BillGates.txt_chunk6,"India, a lot of kids also fight with their parents on inheritance. Have your kids ever spoken to you and be like, “Hey, why are you not giving us everything or anything?” Has it ever happened? A) BILL GATES: You know, you don’t want your kids to ever be confused about your support for them and your love for them. And so I do think explaining early on your philosophy, that you’re going to treat them all equally and that you’re going to give them incredible opportunities, but that the highest calling for these resources is to go back to the neediest through the foundation. And they’ve seen the success of the foundation. I hope they’re very proud of the foundation. And I’ve seen cases where kids actually tell their parents to be more philanthropic. I think the younger generation sometimes actually is pushing against this idea of the wealth just being passed down mostly. And that’s so, every family’s a bit different. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: I have last question on India and then we’ll get to the foundation work and try to understand you as well. If you get an opportunity to invite three Indians for dinner, dead or alive, who would that be? A) BILL GATES: Well, I get to spend time with some incredible people in India and I get time with the Prime Minister and understand his vision and how we fit into that. This 2047 thing that everything is lining up to try to achieve that. There was a great scientist, Raj Bond, who created the Department of Biotechnology. There was a mathematician, Ramanujan, who I would have loved to have met him because he was almost mysterious how he was so genius at what he was able to do.

BillGates.txt_chunk7,"that. There was a great scientist, Raj Bond, who created the Department of Biotechnology. There was a mathematician, Ramanujan, who I would have loved to have met him because he was almost mysterious how he was so genius at what he was able to do. I got to work with Ratan Tata. I’m getting to work with all of the amazing philanthropists and a lot of the innovators here. I get to see small companies. Early on I just went through some of these companies using AI in health, some for profit, a few nonprofit. We had a great 25-year celebration and this great sitar artist came and that was a pretty special thing. So it’d be hard for me to pick. There’s so many incredible talents, you can’t pick three. I think I offend some people by not including them. Starting a Business in India Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Fair. You were talking about small companies. If you were to start something from zero in India today, where would you put most of your time and what the first step you’ll take? A) BILL GATES: Well, you’d mostly start a company because you think you enjoy working on something and you think you have a world class understanding of a unique contribution. For me, that was software for this day and age. If you think you understand fusion, that’s great. If you’re successful, which that’s risky, you could really improve the world. AI is sort of the today’s equivalent of what I did when I was young to see, wow, the possibilities are unlimited. And so I’d probably be doing one of these new AI companies if I was starting out today. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Do you still feel there’s opportunity, a lot of opportunities in AI to build something",BillGates,BillGates.txt,
BillGates.txt_chunk8,"what I did when I was young to see, wow, the possibilities are unlimited. And so I’d probably be doing one of these new AI companies if I was starting out today. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Do you still feel there’s opportunity, a lot of opportunities in AI to build something as significant as what you have built or it’s pretty late? A) BILL GATES: Well, the big companies are putting a lot of money into it and the number of companies globally is huge. Many people didn’t even know these Chinese companies were doing all this work. And yet some of the best results over the last six months have come from three or four of the models there. When I got going in computing, it was a very small set of people. And people thought we were crazy, that we set a computer on every desk and a computer in every home. And that just seemed strange to people because they couldn’t see, they didn’t get software and they didn’t get the exponential improvement of the chips was making computing basically free. So I’d say it’s tougher to get out in front. There will be new companies. I mean, Nvidia is almost as valuable as Apple and Microsoft. And yet they came into prominence only really in the last five or six years, although they’re about 15 years old. So there are opportunities, and there will be some new companies that use AI to achieve unbelievable success, but it’ll be two or three out of 10,000 and would I be able to do that again? Hard to say. Misunderstandings About Bill Gates Q) RAJ SHAMANI: You talked about, like, when you started, a lot of people thought that, what are you doing?

Misunderstandings About Bill Gates Q) RAJ SHAMANI: You talked about, like, when you started, a lot of people thought that, what are you doing? This is some random thing these guys are trying to do. They may be stupid, they may be thinking too big, whatever, right? And over the time, every time you do something big, usually people do not understand you or anyone, like, not just you, like, whoever wants to start something new and big. In today’s world or as of today, what’s the biggest misunderstanding about you? What do you think? What do people misunderstand about Bill Gates? A) BILL GATES: Well, whenever you hear about somebody who’s got some degree of power or ridiculous amounts of money, you might think they have grand schemes, and there’s almost a sense that their values are different than your values and that you should be concerned about their agenda. Hopefully for the people who actually do know me, and how much I love the foundation work and how I work with my friends or my kids, it’s very different from the people who just think, “Oh, wow, he’s one of these guys who’s pushing levers and has too much money and too much authority.” Major Mistakes and Challenges Q) RAJ SHAMANI: So that people misunderstand about you and talk about misunderstanding. Have you made any major mistake that people don’t know about? A) BILL GATES: Well, some of my mistakes are very public. I mean, Microsoft, we had lots of products that didn’t work. We did a phone operating system, and now Android took that position. So I certainly messed that up in a huge way. For the foundation,",BillGates,BillGates.txt,

We did a phone operating system, and now Android took that position. So I certainly messed that up in a huge way. For the foundation, we often have multiple plans. We wanted to have an HIV vaccine. We don’t have that yet. We’re working on a very cheap toilet, but it’s still too expensive, so that’s taking a lot longer. We don’t have polio eradication done. I’m still very committed to that, but it’s taking a lot longer than we thought it would. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: So talking about foundation work, you’ve impacted millions of lives, and you spend a lot in making people’s life better. What’s your biggest challenge today? Because somebody watching this might think that at your level, with so much power, influence, money, you can actually fix a lot of problems. What do you think is your problem? What challenges do you see here? A) BILL GATES: Well, I love the scientific challenges. I mean, we still don’t fully understand malnutrition. We have some tools to reduce it, that’s super exciting, but I’m really pushing our research workers hard that we need to know more about that. I do think getting money to help the very poorest countries, a lot of which are in Africa, is challenging. Asia, many of the countries are having good economic growth. And Africa has a lot of unique governance or instability or disease challenges. Telling people they should help out other humans, even though they’re far away and speak a different language, that’s not as easy as I thought it would be.

Telling people they should help out other humans, even though they’re far away and speak a different language, that’s not as easy as I thought it would be. Right now, some of the rich countries, including my country, are cutting their aid budgets. And I’m very disappointed that, to me, that’s not the golden rule of treating people like you’d like to be treated. Encouraging Young People to Help Others Q) RAJ SHAMANI: So what do you think all the people who are watching this, including me, young people, should do so that we could convince more people to help other people? A) BILL GATES: Well, when you’re young, if you’re here in India, you can probably travel some modest distance—an hour or so—and see people who don’t have the same opportunities you do. They’re smart, but their school’s not good or they get some health problem and they’re not able to access things. I would say, in India, programs like the aspirational district program, India does talk openly about the places that are the worst off. And that’s pretty impressive. Even issues like sanitation, that most governments wouldn’t catch them talking about toilets, this country took on a pretty aggressive plan and made a lot of progress on that. So you can go out and see people and develop empathy without going too far. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: And you spent hours and hours and days in this country, you spent millions on vaccines and trying to take care of health care challenges. What’s one problem you feel that money cannot fix? A) BILL GATES: Hmm. You know, there’s a lot of talk about obesity.

You know, there’s a lot of talk about obesity. And when I saw the prime minister, he was talking about various yoga type things that people would adopt. But it’s been hard. Not many countries have gotten the behavior change. Maybe India can pioneer some approaches there. But frankly, and I’ll sound like a technologist, the most promising thing is actually a drug class called these GLP-1 drugs that are going to go off patent and become cheap. So I always like—I’m a little over-focused on a scientific solution. So maybe a combination of that behavior change and the new tools. But behavior change is hard. We haven’t succeeded in that as much as we’d like to. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Tell me one behavior we all should adopt. A) BILL GATES: Well, the behavior that’s helped me is basically being a student all the time, wanting to learn things and being pretty brutal with myself of do I really understand what’s going on? Do I understand some AI thing or some disease thing? Fortunately, I can meet with people who in many cases can help me understand and then knowledge, if you’re careful about building your knowledge, it all kind of connects together. But reading a lot, being a student, having people who can teach me, that’s been not only fun for me, but also a big part of my success.

RAJ SHAMANI: So all of people who are watching this actually feels pretty validated at this point because this whole podcast is about learning from really incredible people like you. And we have so many questions that we just keep asking to learn more, to get inside your brain. So thanks for validation. BILL GATES: Perfect. Gates Foundation’s Work in India Q) RAJ SHAMANI: What’s fascinating for me this time in your journey, like this time, your visit to India, the full Gates Foundation board is here and that’s pretty unique. And they get to experience India. What do you think? What are your priorities with regards to this nation? Why is the whole board here? What are you guys trying to figure out? What are the things that you’re doing? A) BILL GATES: Well, as much progress as we’ve been part of achieving here in India, there’s still a lot to do. The child death rate is about a third of what it was, but it’s still almost three times higher than in a rich country. So we should all want to close that gap. That’s equity. I mentioned malnutrition. The country is very serious about that. And yet, it means that your brain never develops. And sadly, if whatever dietary or disease things affect you during pregnancy, in your first year, even if later you get a fantastic diet, your brain and your physical capabilities, they don’t adjust. You’re sort of permanently affected. We’re working with some great scientists here. A lot of the tools of biology have gotten a lot better. So I do think in the next decade, we’ll totally get to the bottom of that. And I’m thrilled to do that. And a lot of the scientists we partner",BillGates,BillGates.txt,

So I do think in the next decade, we’ll totally get to the bottom of that. And I’m thrilled to do that. And a lot of the scientists we partner with, including some at ICMR, but lots of institutions around the country, they’re also committed to that. Predicting Future Trends Q) RAJ SHAMANI: So you work here a lot, and with the foundation, you work around the world on a lot of things. And because of all of this passion and data and this intention to try to help people, you’ve been pretty accurate in trying to understand trends way before normal people. You were pretty accurate in predicting so many epidemics as well. Is there something that you know which we don’t? How do you spot these things way faster? A) BILL GATES: Well, the biggest change agent in my lifetime has been the miracle of digital, now moving into the AI phase of that digital revolution. The fact that as a young person, I was programming at age 13, and by 18, I had thousands of hours of really strong feedback about getting better and being pushed. It’s a really lucky thing to have such a familiarity with the thing that’s going to change the world. I wrote a book called “The Road Ahead” a long time ago that talked about the Internet and digital money and video conferencing. Then when I moved into the foundation work, the health work, people in that community understand pandemics. And so my saying, “Hey, there’s a big risk, and the thing that’s going to kill 10 million additional people is likely to be a pandemic”—that’s commonplace knowledge if you’re in the",BillGates,BillGates.txt,

And so my saying, “Hey, there’s a big risk, and the thing that’s going to kill 10 million additional people is likely to be a pandemic”—that’s commonplace knowledge if you’re in the global health community. It’s a very small community. But I was just somebody who was listened to stating this. And sadly, most of the people who listened to that prediction listened to it after it came true. What my goal was, was for people to hear that and actually stop it from happening. Current Fears and Concerns Q) RAJ SHAMANI: That’s usually the case, right? Like, people listen to pieces, golden advice, nuggets way after the time has passed. Because of this, do you fear anything today? A) BILL GATES: I definitely hope that we shape AI in a positive way. It’s such a big impact on being smarter than humans that it will change our world a lot. And it’s definitely new territory. So I have a list of about five things. AI—shaping AI properly is at the top of that list. But avoiding the next pandemic, avoiding nuclear war, bioterrorism, climate change. It’s only about five or six things that we need to minimize the chance of and use our additional wealth and insights against those things. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Do you have any personal fear? What’s your biggest fear? A) BILL GATES: You know, it’s not like I’m afraid of heights or planes or fire or anything like that. I hope I’m—I’ll be sad as my brain gets less capable, which, as I turn 70 this year, I’d be lucky to have 20 years of being able to learn.

I hope I’m—I’ll be sad as my brain gets less capable, which, as I turn 70 this year, I’d be lucky to have 20 years of being able to learn. Maybe I’ll get lucky and get a little bit more. But that disappoints me because I had such an amazing time learning things and I used to think of old people as not contributing all that much and now I’ve had to change my mind about how important old people are. RAJ SHAMANI: Do you feel different? BILL GATES: I don’t at all. Probably if I took an IQ test, I would do a little bit worse than when I was 25. But I’ve accumulated enough knowledge, so wisdom can compensate a little bit for a slight reduction in intelligence. And I do think it’s like a muscle that if you’re pushing yourself to think and learn, you stay—it really helps your capabilities a lot. But yeah, I have a fear that eventually I’ll lose—I won’t want to pick up a 500-page book. I’ll look at it and go, “Are you kidding? I’m done with that.” Q) RAJ SHAMANI: So with age, you have not felt any changes in your brain? BILL GATES: Not really in terms of flow. RAJ SHAMANI: Wow. A) BILL GATES: No, I don’t think so. Whenever you can’t remember something, you’re like, “Oh no!” But maybe a tiny bit of that, but then it’s just a little bit because you’re looking for it. When I was in my 20s, if I couldn’t remember something, I was like, “So what?” Changes Over Time Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Is there any change you feel because, so Bill Gates at 25 and Bill Gates at 70, is",BillGates,BillGates.txt,

A) BILL GATES: Well, in my 20s I chose to focus on one topic from age 20 to about 31 or 32. I told myself, “Hey, I love biology and math and all these things, but I want to be the person who’s advancing software faster than anyone else.” And so I really did narrow my focus, and I didn’t take much time off, and I could stay in the office 72 hours and then crash. So my adrenaline was really unique. Now, my understanding of how to manage people other than myself wasn’t that good. I look back and I’ve learned a lot since then, but just my stamina and focus for that period of my life, being kind of a maniac was the right thing. My competitors would say, “Oh, no, you work too hard.” And I’d say, “Yes, I do.” Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Do you think that’s great advice for every young person who’s watching? Be a maniac in your 20s? A) BILL GATES: It’s not for everyone. But if you’re in a race and a little bit moving a little bit faster can make a difference, then, yes, your 20s, when you have no wife and no children, that’s the time to do it.

What are you currently learning or what do you want to learn now? A) BILL GATES: Well, there’s a lot going on. I just staying on top of that is something I very much enjoy, and I get to sit and talk with the top people at OpenAI, and I get to play around with things. But then when you think about what about AI applied to mental health care, isn’t that one of the most exciting things? Because we can never have enough therapists and even people who aren’t suffering massively, maybe we could help even people with mild symptoms. What does this AI companion look like, and how can that help us? My friend Reid Hoffman just wrote a book called “Super Agency.” He’s got a really good chapter about this. So I’m pushing myself to try and understand what can we do there and meet the people who are pushing the boundaries, because I see such potential. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: So what would you advise young people to start learning today and from where? AI itself? A) BILL GATES: Well, if you have a mathematical mind, not everyone should learn AI. These tools are going to be available to everyone, and so you ought to be a user of AI.

And even people who grew up with software, some of them don’t really get this because it’s a bit more mathematical than it is just a programming type thing. So as a user, if you like doing creative work, yes, AI is going to change your world. And AI hopefully can help you do things faster and better. So my prescription would be to use it for the areas that you’re excited about. RAJ SHAMANI: Any area that you’re excited about. Learn from, learn about that, and try to make a bridge between AI and that industry. BILL GATES: Right. I mean, the Internet has so much educational material on it. So between all that material and then an AI that can help take long documents and you can have a dialogue with it. You can do it in text or you can now do these generated podcasts about things. It’s a great time to be a learner. When I was young, I had to go to the library and read the encyclopedia alphabetically, no multimedia. This is a paradise. India’s Role in Global Philanthropy Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Yeah. Thanks to you guys, because the digital world, you made it easy for us.

A) BILL GATES: Well, more and more of the innovation is being done in India. India’s got a depth of talent and a desire for frugal solutions. And so even though the rich world, US, Europe, we have a lot of talent for some basic science thing like immunology, a lot of the new insights will keep coming from those institutions. But when it comes to actually putting the pieces together, including something like AI for healthcare, I was just meeting with a number of companies working on various pieces of that in India. We need better seeds and we need better weather advice for farmers. And so although we’re going to continue to do a lot of implementation here in India, help get things rolled out, more and more of our sort of product research work will be done here, both because it benefits India, but we’re also very good if it’s saving Indian children really working well. Our foundation has a lot of presence in Africa. So even take the classic example where India was totally the leader on this digital public infrastructure, the digital money and identity Aadhaar thing, funding the Africans to come here and learn and helping to create the open source software that makes it easy for them.

If the world had to write one sentence next to the name Bill Gates, what would you want them to write? A) BILL GATES: You know, I don’t do my work based on some epitaph. Ideally, they’d say that, wow, there were these diseases around, polio and malaria and malnutrition, and now we don’t have to think about that, partly because he championed putting more great thinking and resources into ending those problems. I hope people look at the word polio and go, what was that? When you read Dickens novels and they talk about somebody had consumption, it’s like, what is that? Well, that’s actually TB. So hopefully some problems that we can actually finish and then move on. Q) RAJ SHAMANI: Which problem do you think will be finishing? A) BILL GATES: Well, polio. I expect even in five years that’ll give us the credibility to go after things like malaria and measles. RAJ SHAMANI: That’s amazing. BILL GATES: Oh, it is. It’s going to be fun. RAJ SHAMANI: It’s amazing. In five years we can make that a reality. It’s going to be incredible for humankind. Wow. BILL GATES: Yeah. It’s only happened once. Smallpox was eliminated back in 1980.

AjantaCaves.txt_chunk1,"Ajanta Caves The first Buddhist cave monuments at Ajanta date from the 2nd and 1st centuries B.C. During the Gupta period (5th and 6th centuries A.D.), many more richly decorated caves were added to the original group. The paintings and sculptures of Ajanta, considered masterpieces of Buddhist religious art, have had a considerable artistic influence. Outstanding Universal Value Brief synthesis The caves at Ajanta are excavated out of a vertical cliff above the left bank of the river Waghora in the hills of Ajanta. They are thirty in number, including the unfinished ones, of which five (caves 9, 10, 19, 26 and 29) are chaityagrihas (sanctuary) and the rest, sangharamas or viharas (monastery). The caves are connected with the river by rock-cut staircases. The excavation activity was carried out in two different phases separated by an interval of about four centuries. The first phase coincides with the rule of the Satavahana dynasty from about the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century BCE, while the second phase corresponds to the Basim branch of the Vakataka dynasty with their Asmaka and Rishika feudatories in the 5th to 6th centuries CE. Altogether, six caves (caves 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 15A) were excavated in the first phase by Hinayana/Theravadin followers of Buddhism, wherein Buddha was worshipped in an aniconic/symbolic form. These caves are simple and austere, and carry mural paintings sparsely. The chaityagrihas are characterized by a vaulted ceiling and an apsidal end, the façade dominated by a horseshoe-shaped window, known as chaitya window. Internally, they are divided by colonnades into a central nave and side aisles, the latter continuing behind the apse for circumambulation. At the centre of the apse stands the object of worship in the form of a chaitya or stupa, also hewn out of the rock. The",AjantaCaves,AjantaCaves.txt,

At the centre of the apse stands the object of worship in the form of a chaitya or stupa, also hewn out of the rock. The monasteries consist of an astylar hall meant for congregation, and range of cells on three sides serving as the dwelling-apartments (viharas) for monks. In the second phase, the rupestral activity was dominated by the Mahayana followers of Buddhism, where Buddha was worshipped in an icon/idol form. The earlier caves were reused, and several new ones were excavated. The architectural forms of the earlier phase continued, however, with a renewed architectural and sculptural fervour. The walls were embellished with exquisite mural paintings, executed in tempera technique; and pillars, brackets, door jambs, shrines and facades were richly decorated with sculptural splendour. The unfinished caves (caves 5, 24, 29) provide excellent evidences of techniques and methodology employed in rock excavation. Ajanta Caves exemplifies one of the greatest achievements in ancient Buddhist rock-cut architecture. The artistic traditions at Ajanta present an important and rare specimen of art, architecture, painting, and socio-cultural, religious and political history of contemporary society in India. The development of Buddhism manifested through the architecture, sculptures, and paintings is unique and bears testimony to the importance of Ajanta as a major hub of such activities. Further, the epigraphic records found at Ajanta provide good information on the contemporary civilization. Criterion (i): Ajanta is a unique artistic achievement.

BiographyofRudyardKipling.txt_chunk1,"Rudyard Kipling (born December 30, 1865, Bombay [now Mumbai], India—died January 18, 1936, London, England) was an English short-story writer, poet, and novelist chiefly remembered for his celebration of British imperialism, his tales and poems of British soldiers in India, and his tales for children. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. Life Kipling’s father, John Lockwood Kipling, was an artist and scholar who had considerable influence on his son’s work, became curator of the Lahore Museum, and is described presiding over this “wonder house” in the first chapter of Kim, Rudyard’s most famous novel. His mother was Alice Macdonald, two of whose sisters married the highly successful 19th-century painters Sir Edward Burne-Jones and Sir Edward Poynter, while a third married Alfred Baldwin and became the mother of Stanley Baldwin, later prime minister. These connections were of lifelong importance to Kipling. Much of his childhood was unhappy. Kipling was taken to England by his parents at the age of six and was left for five years at a foster home at Southsea, the horrors of which he described in the story “Baa Baa, Black Sheep” (1888). He then went on to the United Services College at Westward Ho, north Devon, a new, inexpensive, and inferior boarding school. It haunted Kipling for the rest of his life—but always as the glorious place celebrated in Stalky & Co. (1899) and related stories: an unruly paradise in which the highest goals of English education are met amid a tumult of teasing, bullying, and beating. The Stalky saga is one of Kipling’s great imaginative achievements. Readers repelled by a strain of brutality—even of cruelty—in his writings should remember the sensitive and shortsighted boy who was brought to terms with the ethos of this deplorable establishment through the demands of self-preservation.

Readers repelled by a strain of brutality—even of cruelty—in his writings should remember the sensitive and shortsighted boy who was brought to terms with the ethos of this deplorable establishment through the demands of self-preservation. Rudyard Kipling Rudyard Kipling Kipling returned to India in 1882 and worked for seven years as a journalist. His parents, although not officially important, belonged to the highest Anglo-Indian society, and Rudyard thus had opportunities for exploring the whole range of that life. All the while he had remained keenly observant of the thronging spectacle of native India, which had engaged his interest and affection from earliest childhood. He was quickly filling the journals he worked for with prose sketches and light verse. He published the verse collection Departmental Ditties in 1886, the short-story collection Plain Tales from the Hills in 1888, and between 1887 and 1889 he brought out six paper-covered volumes of short stories. Among the latter were Soldiers Three, The Phantom Rickshaw (containing the story “The Man Who Would Be King”), and Wee Willie Winkie (containing “Baa Baa, Black Sheep”). When Kipling returned to England in 1889, his reputation had preceded him, and within a year he was acclaimed as one of the most brilliant prose writers of his time. His fame was redoubled upon the publication in 1892 of the verse collection Barrack-Room Ballads, which contained such popular poems as “Mandalay,” “Gunga Din,” and “Danny Deever.” Not since the English poet Lord Byron had such a reputation been achieved so rapidly. When the poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson, died in 1892, it may be said that Kipling took his place in popular estimation.

When the poet laureate Alfred, Lord Tennyson, died in 1892, it may be said that Kipling took his place in popular estimation. In 1892 Kipling married Caroline Balestier, the sister of Wolcott Balestier, an American publisher and writer with whom he had collaborated in The Naulahka (1892), a facile and unsuccessful romance. That year the young couple moved to the United States and settled on Mrs. Kipling’s property in Vermont, but their manners and attitudes were considered objectionable by their neighbours. Unable or unwilling to adjust to life in America, the Kiplings returned to England in 1896. Ever after Kipling remained very aware that Americans were “foreigners,” and he extended to them, as to the French, no more than a semi-exemption from his proposition that only “lesser breeds” are born beyond the English Channel. Book Jacket of ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" by American children's author illustrator Eric Carle (born 1929) Britannica Quiz Classic Children’s Books Quiz Besides numerous short-story collections and poetry collections such as The Seven Seas (1896), Kipling published his best-known novels in the 1890s and immediately thereafter. His novel The Light That Failed (1890) is the story of a painter going blind and spurned by the woman he loves. Captains Courageous (1897), in spite of its sense of adventure, is burdened by excessive descriptive writing. Kim (1901), about an Irish orphan in India, is a classic. The Jungle Book (1894) and The Second Jungle Book (1895) are stylistically superb collections of stories.

Rudyard Kipling's house Rudyard Kipling's houseBateman's, the house purchased by Rudyard Kipling in 1902, Burwash, East Sussex, England. In 1902 Kipling bought a house at Burwash, Sussex, which remained his home until his death. Sussex was the background of much of his later writing—especially in Puck of Pook’s Hill (1906) and Rewards and Fairies (1910), two volumes that, although devoted to simple dramatic presentations of English history, embodied some of his deepest intuitions. In 1907 he received the Nobel Prize for Literature, the first Englishman to be so honoured. In South Africa, where he spent much time, he was given a house by Cecil Rhodes, the diamond magnate and South African statesman. This association fostered Kipling’s imperialist persuasions, which were to grow stronger with the years. These convictions are not to be dismissed in a word: they were bound up with a genuine sense of a civilizing mission that required every Englishman, or, more broadly, every white man, to bring European culture to those he considered the heathen natives of the uncivilized world. Kipling’s ideas were not in accord with much that was liberal in the thought of the age, and, as he became older, he was an increasingly isolated figure. When he died, two days before King George V, he must have seemed to many a far less representative Englishman than his sovereign. Access for the whole family!

Kipling’s poems and stories were extraordinarily popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, but after World War I his reputation as a serious writer suffered through his being widely viewed as a jingoistic imperialist. (His rehabilitation was attempted, however, by T.S. Eliot.) His verse is indeed vigorous, and in dealing with the lives and colloquial speech of common soldiers and sailors it broke new ground. Balladry, music hall song, and popular hymnology provide its unassuming basis; even at its most serious—as in “Recessional” (1897) and similar pieces in which Kipling addressed himself to his fellow countrymen in times of crisis—the effect is rhetorical rather than imaginative. But it is otherwise with Kipling’s prose. In the whole sweep of his adult storytelling, he displays a steadily developing art, from the early volumes of short stories set in India through the collections Life’s Handicap (1891), Many Inventions (1893), The Day’s Work (1898), Traffics and Discoveries (1904), Actions and Reactions (1909), Debits and Credits (1926), and Limits and Renewals (1932). While his later stories cannot exactly be called better than the earlier ones, they are as good—and they bring a subtler if less dazzling technical proficiency to the exploration of deeper though sometimes more perplexing themes. It is a far cry from the broadly effective eruption of the supernatural in The Phantom Rickshaw (1888) to its subtle exploitation in “The Wish House” or “A Madonna of the Trenches” (1924), or from the innocent chauvinism of the bravura “The Man Who Was” (1890) to the depth of implication beneath the seemingly insensate xenophobia of Mary Postgate (1915).

There is much in Kipling’s later art to curtail its popular appeal. It is compressed and elliptical in manner and sombre in many of its themes. The author’s critical reputation declined steadily during his lifetime—a decline that can scarcely be accounted for except in terms of political prejudice. Paradoxically, postcolonial critics later rekindled an intense interest in his work, viewing it as both symptomatic and critical of imperialist attitudes. “The Elephant's Child” “The Elephant's Child”Rudyard Kipling's illustration for “The Elephant's Child” from Just So Stories (1902).

MoneyHeist.txt_chunk2,"as the pages fly by, you realize you have no idea what the story is really about. You’re lost in a sea of words, bobbing along without a compass to guide you. But then, suddenly, a beam of light breaks through the clouds. You see the story’s true purpose, and everything falls into place. The conflicts grow more intense, the characters more complex, and you can’t turn the pages fast enough. Now, imagine a story that starts with that same sense of clarity and purpose. From the very first sentence, you know exactly what you’re in for. The rules of the game are laid out before you, the pieces of the puzzle placed perfectly on the board. You’re ready to play. That’s the kind of beginning Money Heist has. It grabs you by the collar and doesn’t let go, weaving a tale of intrigue and excitement that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It’s a perfect example of how to start a story off right, setting the stage for a journey you won’t soon forget. Crescendo of Conflicts Conflict is the driving force behind any good story. It’s what gives your characters the chance to grow and develop, and it’s what keeps your audience on the edge of their seats. In Money Heist, conflict is everywhere. The characters are constantly at odds with each other, as well as with the outside forces trying to bring them down. But it’s not just the conflicts themselves that make Money Heist so compelling. It’s also the way the show handles the moments in between. The writers expertly weave in anecdotes and conversations that not only give us insight into the characters but also serve to ratchet up the tension.

The writers expertly weave in anecdotes and conversations that not only give us insight into the characters but also serve to ratchet up the tension. One minute we’re laughing at a story from the training days, and the next we’re holding our breath as a gang member’s life hangs in the balance. So, when you’re crafting your own story, don’t be afraid to pile on the conflicts. Just make sure to give your characters the space to breathe and grow in between. It’s those quiet moments that will make your conflicts all the more powerful when they do come to a head. Beauty of Flaws As the old saying goes, “Black and white are a thing of the past; grey is the new normal.” The characters in the show Money Heist are no exception to this rule. Even The Professor, the mastermind behind the heist, has his own fears and flaws. From misogynistic tendencies to narcissistic behavior, the characters in the show are a diverse mix of imperfections. But it is these very imperfections that make them so relatable and human. Each character has a past or a secret that shapes their actions, and it is the combination of their strengths and weaknesses that makes them unique and three-dimensional. But it’s not just only their flaws that make the characters of Money Heist so memorable. It’s also the small, personal moments that truly bring them to life. Whether it’s a moment of happiness, a prank, or just a moment of pure stupidity, these are the moments that connect us to the characters and make us root for them.

Tokyo — The Unpredictable In the show, Tokyo is the character that everyone turns to when things start to spin out of control. Even the writers of the show rely on her for inspiration when it comes to crafting the plot. However, as the show progresses and the conflicts escalate, it can be easy for the plot to become repetitive. If there isn’t enough time for the characters to react and recover, the story can lose its touch of realism. That’s where Tokyo comes in. She is impulsive and unpredictable, and that’s exactly what keeps the show interesting. When the Spanish police or intelligence agency takes action against the gang and The Professor’s strategies successfully counter their moves, there is enough time for the opposing team to regroup and come up with a new plan. Similarly, when the hostages come up with their own schemes, Tokyo’s reactions set off a chain of events that keep the show fresh and exciting. In summary, to keep a story “on edge” and avoid it becoming dull, it’s important to have a character or element that adds an element of unpredictability. For the show in question, that character is Tokyo, whose impulsive actions help to keep the plot moving forward and avoid any lulls in the action.

Symbolic Significance Money Heist is a thrilling show about resistance and a refusal to conform to the system. At the heart of the show is the Professor, a mastermind who leads his team in heists that are not only daring and complex but also serve as a form of resistance against the establishment. But the show’s themes of resistance and skepticism towards society are not just conveyed through the Professor’s words and actions. The show also uses powerful symbols to represent these ideas. The Salvador Dali masks worn by the team during the heists symbolize their anonymity and their rejection of societal norms. The red jumpsuits, worn by all members of the team, represent their unity and their commitment to their cause. And the phrase “Bella Ciao,” which is sung by the team during the heists, is a symbol of resistance against oppression and injustice. Overall, Money Heist uses these symbols in a compelling way to represent the core themes of resistance and skepticism toward society. As viewers, we are drawn into the story and fully immersed in the world of the show, experiencing the thrill of resistance alongside the characters. It’s a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up for what we believe in and refusing to be controlled by the expectations of society.",MoneyHeist,MoneyHeist.txt,
News.txt_chunk1,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has admitted that the company’s latest AI model – GPT-5 had a ‘bumpy’ launch. The confession was made during a Reddit Ask Me Anything session on Friday, August 8 where Altman and members of the GPT-5 team answered questions about new features, problems at launch, and the now-famous “chart crime”. What is OpenAI’s ‘chart crime’ moment During GPT-5’s presentation, a flawed chart sparked jokes online. The chart misrepresented SWE-bench Verified data, exaggerating GPT-5's accuracy (74.9% with thinking, 52.8% without) compared to OpenAI o3 (69.1%) and GPT-4o (30.8%), likely due to swapped or misaligned bars, as noted in OpenAI's own SWE-bench Verified documentation released on August 7, 2025.

BIJNOR: A 35-year-old man, who had returned home from Haryana to celebrate Rakshabandhan with his family, died after being swept away by strong currents on a waterlogged road in Bijnor district, said police on Saturday. Neetu Singh went to nearby Sahaspur town on his scooter on Friday to withdraw money from a bank. While returning to Kiwar village, he reached a stretch near Jairampur village, which had been flooded for the past three days due to rainfall. Despite villagers warning him not to proceed on the submerged road, Singh chose to continue. As soon as he entered the waterlogged road, a strong current caused him to lose balance and fall, and swept him away. Locals found his body after two hours. Police sent the body to the district hospital for autopsy. Bijnor SP Abhishek Jha said, ""Neetu worked as a factory supervisor in Haryana and had returned to Kaiwar to celebrate the festival with his two sisters. The body has been handed over to his family after autopsy on Saturday, and legal proceedings are on.""

Sabke boss unable to accept India’s growth’: Rajnath Singh’s swipe at Trump Defence minister says attempts are being made to make Indian products costlier, but asserts no power can stop India from becoming a global power Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday appeared to take aim at US President Donald Trump over the steep tariff threats to India, saying that some people , whom he described as the “sabke boss,” are unable to accept the pace of India’s rise as a global power. Singh said there were some people who were unhappy with the pace of India’s development and could not accept how quickly the country was progressing. According to him, these quarters believed they were “the boss of all” and questioned how India was growing at such a fast rate. He added that many were trying to ensure products made in India became more expensive than those made elsewhere, so that rising prices would deter global buyers. “This effort is underway,” he said, asserting with full confidence that no power in the world could now stop India from becoming a major global power. Trump recently imposed a 25% tariff on Indian imports, along with an additional 25% penalty, in retaliation for New Delhi’s continued purchase of Russian oil. The US President also warned of further tariff hikes, demanded that India halt its dealings with Russia, dismissed India’s economy as “dead,” and faced accusations from his close aides that New Delhi was financing Russia’s war in Ukraine. Singh said the current situation had not impacted India’s defence exports, which were continuing to grow.

Recipies.txt_chunk1,"Potatoes with rosemary and sea salt: A great marriage is one where each person, without agenda, celebrates the unique and distinctive characteristics of the other, and lovingly helps them be the best possible version of themselves. When I see a couple who express this in their relationship I am always moved and inspired, because they are so much more together than they could possibly be individually. In my world I have a number of friends whose marriages have worked out this principle for many years and each day they bring joy to each other, and those in their sphere of influence. rosemary4 resized In a very roundabout way, this is an introduction to the marriage of ingredients and this recipe. Tomatoes and basil, chocolate and coffee, peas and mint are ingredients that belong together, and, when paired in a recipe with love, care and a little finesse, bring out the very best in each other while still maintaining their individual and distinctive flavours. Potatoes and rosemary are another such pairing, and in this simple, simple recipe bring out the absolute best in each other. It’s a perfect accompaniment to grilled meat or fish and salad.

Let sit for about 20 minutes then drain and dry well with a tea towel. Pick the leaves off the rosemary and place in the base of a 20 cm round or 18 cm square dish. This enables their earthy flavour to infuse the potatoes as they cook and keeps them from burning and becoming bitter. Stack the potato slices in the dish, quite tightly. They will shrink a little as they cook. Drizzle with the olive oil and season well with sea salt and black pepper. Bake for 45 – 55 minutes, until the potatoes are golden and crispy around the edges.

Sholay.txt_chunk1,"Many years ago I got myself coerced into watching a number of Bollywood films by some Asian work friends who, as far as I could tell, thought it was funny that I’d actually watch them. To them Bollywood films was entirely a product of their culture and, by proxy, should make no sense to a silly Englishman such as myself. Over some time I sat and watched Baazigar, Daag: The Fire and Gharwali Baharwali. All of which are damn enjoyable films and quite a good crash course in modern Bollywood movies. None of those movie hold a candle to the film I’m reviewing today though. Sholay goes beyond being a big deal in India. It played solidly in cinemas for 5 years and it still wouldn’t be too hard to find a cinema showing it today some 38 years later. When adjusted for inflation it is the highest grossing Indian film of all time. It also proves that Bollywood films aren’t just for the people of their homeland. I say this because Sholay is one of the greatest Westerns of all time. Click the link for my review. Sholay tells the story of a former police officer named Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) who, after losing his family to a bandit called Gabbar Singh (Ahmjad Khan) calls upon the help of two criminals he had met years earlier who had displayed an uncharacteristic level of bravery and honour when they helped him stop a train hijacking. The two criminals Jai (Amitabh Bachchan) and Veeru (Dharmendra) are at first only concerned with ripping off the Thakur (A word which means Lord, he runs a small village community) and plan on stealing the money from his safe. But things get personal and the duo soon find themselves learning how to become better,",Sholay,Sholay.txt,

But things get personal and the duo soon find themselves learning how to become better, less crime obsessed, people along the way. The film plays with themes of revenge, social status and appearances as well as being on violent piece of action. Enjoy a Bud Light with this film... and your maybe boyfriend. Enjoy a Bud Light with this film… and your maybe boyfriend. So the story sounds Western enough right? Sounds like it’s ripped straight from a Sergio Leone movie. That is not as far as the influence of the Spaghetti Western and the films of Sam Peckinpah go though. The film is set mostly within a small rocky area of India called Ramanagara. One google search of that place and you’ll see that it looks exactly like the wild west. That and the location of a number of fights involving Captain Kirk and a Gorn. To add to that the film uses many camera techniques and incorporates many elements of the violent Westerns of the late 60s and 70s. The snap zooms, the deep focus range, the more artistic camera work and editing to sell the drama at key moments. The film literally oozes with the feel and style of the Italian and American Westerns. But that doesn’t mean Sholay is a facsimile of those films.

Hell, you can refer to Bollywood films and being Sholay BC and Sholay AD, as in it defined the genre so much that it shaped all that came after. So what makes Sholay the ultimate Bollywood film despite it being very heavily influence by Westerns? It’s 3 hours and 25 minutes long. It features a number of heavily choreographed dance sequences, as many as it’s action sequences in fact. It deals with Indian social structure and the pursuit of fitting into a particular role that will help others. It deals with our heroes finding the loves of their lives. It features specific elements of Indian culture. It manages to switch from being a stunt heavy action movie, to a farcical comedy, to a musical and to a romantic comedy with little to no effort. The festival of colours sequence where Hema Malini’s Basanti stops talking and starts singing is pure Indian musical cinema. The film combines every element you could consider to be an intrinsic part of the Bollywood film experience and still manages to show that it isn’t a film created in a bubble free of external influence. It is entirely Indian but also Western too. The fact it mixes so many varieties of story tropes, influences and genres without ever feeling incoherent is a marvel. Do not mess with this guy.

The film is also not afraid to get really dark. 2 children are murdered, one via torture. That second child being the only son of a blind man who had spent the film trying to convince his son to leave the village for better things. The character of Radha (Jaya Bahduri) has been rendered mute after witnessing the deaths of the Thakur’s family, her husband included. How can a film feature such depressing elements and yet still manage to reference Chaplin’s The Great Dictator early on? Because it can, that’s why. Director Ramesh Sippy clearly gave no shits about what he should and shouldn’t do and in many ways his ability to pull together conflicting styles so well kinda makes him a precursor to directors such as Tarantino.
